Have a Definitions unit or something like that.

Each unit will add appropriate definitions (like the Flash.h).  For example, if
you include one of the Gravity units, on loading the Gravity unit will add a
Gravity variable to the Definitions unit, and perhaps a gacc_variable.  Then on
initialization, Gravity unit will add to the Grid unit a new grid variable,
something like "Grid.gacc = Grid.new_variable(Grid.SCALAR,Grid.CENTER)".
Similarly, the Hydro units will have things like:
   "Grid.dens = Grid.new_variable(Grid.SCALAR, Grid.CENTER)"
   "Grid.momentum = Grid.new_variable(Grid.VECTOR, Grid.CENTER)"
