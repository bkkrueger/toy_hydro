Toy Hydro
=======

My toy hydrodynamics code (in development).

This project is intended as a space to practice algorithms, rather than
a serious intent at software development.  The goal is to establish some
baseline of algorithms to understand the needed functionality, then
scrap it and build an actual hydro simulation tool with proper software
design principles.
