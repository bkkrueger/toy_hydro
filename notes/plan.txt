Start with
- linear advection of one variable
- 1D
- Cartesian
- uniform grid
- serial

Generalizations:
- linear advection of one variable
  - multiple variables (one advection speed)
  - multiple variables (different advection speeds)
  - nonlinear advection (advecting the velocity itself as one of the variables)
  - coupled/nonlinear equations (e.g. 1D adiabatic Euler)
  - full Euler
- 1D
  - 2D
  - 3D
- Cartesian
  - polar
  - cylindrical
  - spherical
  - generalized orthogonal coordinates
- uniform grid
  - AMR
  - moving mesh (e.g. AREPO)
- serial
  - parallel (distributed memory)
  - parallel (shared memory? multicore processors? hybrid?)
- equation of state
  - gamma-law EoS
  - general EoS
- Riemann solver
  - linearized Riemann solver
  - general Riemann solver
- reconstruction
  - Godunov (piecewise constant)
  - general reconstruction
    - non-limited piecewise linear
    - MUSCL
    - PPM
- sources
  - sourceless
  - sources
    - heating/cooling
    - external gravity
    - self-gravity
    - diffusive processes (like viscosity)
- species
  - one species
  - multiple (non-reacting) species
  - reactive hydro (reactions act as sources/sinks, so do sources first)
